This directory holds all the Autoconf/Automake (and maybe scripts) we
rely on in several projects.

Please, do not install standard files that are installed by the
bootstrapping script, such as config.guess, install-sh, ltmain.sh etc.
They should be svn:ignored.

Do add an Makefile.am either: it is the top-level Makefile which
should ship these files, for instance

       EXTRA_DIST = build-aux/bootstrap

But it should not be needed: Automake automatically ships included
Makefile snippets, and Autoconf M4 bits.

* build-aux.mk
Provides convenient targets wrapping build-aux and libport handling.
In the case of kernel1, the dependency on liburbi is implemented
similarly.  Here are the EXTERNAL names:

	    directory	 | EXTERNAL name
	    -------------+---------------
	    build-aux	 | baux
	    liburbi-c++	 | liburbi
	    libport	 | libport

** EXTERNAL-up
Update EXTERNAL to the most recent version, and pin it.

** EXTERNAL-pin
Subscribe to the most recent version.

** EXTERNAL-ci
You made modification in EXTERNAL.  So check them in, then run the
corresponding EXTERNAL-up.

** recheck
Unrelated to the previous targets: just relaunches configure and make
again (in case something changed in the environment).  Named after
./config.status --recheck.

* init.mk
Initializes some Automake variables so that we can always use += on them.

* install-sh-c
Our own copy of install-sh that support -C in addition.  Useful to
avoid installing headers that did not change.

* rebox.el
An Emacs file to build nice comment boxes

		/*------------.
		| Like this.  |
		`------------*/

automatically.
		
* reindent
A simplistic Perl script that try to normalize the look of the code.
It is very stupid and has no form of knowledge of C++, so use with
care.

* revision.mk, version.hh.in
This is used to insert Subversion keywords in the programs, in the
banners for instance.

To use this module, insert something like this in your Makefile.am:

   REVISION_FILE = version.hh
   include $(top_srcdir)/build-aux/revision.mk

since it extends (using +=), BUILT_SOURCES, EXTRA_DIST and CLEANFILES,
they should be defined before the include.
