This directory holds all the Autoconf/Automake (and maybe scripts) we
rely on in several projects.

Please, do not install standard files that are installed by the
bootstrapping script, such as config.guess, install-sh, ltmain.sh etc.
They should be svn:ignored.

Do add an Makefile.am either: it is the top-level Makefile which
should ship these files, for instance

       EXTRA_DIST = build-aux/bootstrap

But it should not be needed: Automake automatically ships included
Makefile snippets, and Autoconf M4 bits.

* revision.mk, version.hh.in
This is used to insert Subversion keywords in the programs, in the
banners for instance.

To use this module, insert something like this in your Makefile.am:

   REVISION_FILE = version.hh
   include $(top_srcdir)/build-aux/revision.mk

since it extends (using +=), BUILT_SOURCES, EXTRA_DIST and CLEANFILES,
they should be defined before the include.
