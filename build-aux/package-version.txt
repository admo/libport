The traditional Autotools approach requires that the version string be
static (i.e., available at Autoconf time via AC_INIT).  This is very
painful, as to keep the version information up to date, autoconf must
be launched again, which in term should change config.h, resulting in
never-ending recompilation cycles, especially if you want to depend on
the actual revision!

So we try to work around this.

To hide our tricks from Autoconf and Automake, we define a fake static
version (UNDEFINED), and use a GNUmakefile.

URBI_PACKAGE_VERSION is used by configure load the actual version
string from the file .version.

package-version.mk (to be loaded by GNUmakefile after Automake's
makefile) creates and maintains .version as up to date as possible.
