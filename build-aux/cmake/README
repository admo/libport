* Introduction

This file describe how to use cmake to compile a project and the
organization of this directory. For further information about how to
write new modules for cmake see the README file in the modules directory.

* How to install cmake

You can either download a binary package or a source package from:

    http://www.cmake.org/HTML/Download.html

For the source package, follow the instruction in Readme.txt

* How to customize compilation flags

You can customize compilation flags either using the command line
arguments or tweaking the option using the GUI (cmake-gui). Note, that
at any time if you want to restart from the scratch you have to remove
the CMakeCache.txt file in your build directory.

** Source/Binary directory

The binary directory is the current path from where you start cmake. The source
directory is the first argument. Typically:

  $ mkdir _build
  $ cd _build
  $ cmake ..

** Generator

On Unix the best generator (and default one) is 'Unix Makefiles'. Use
-G to specify it. See cmake -h for the list of available generators.

Once cmake as finished run 'make' and 'make install'.

** Specify non standard library path

On Unix the most common way is to use CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH as it behaves more or
less like configure --with-PACKAGE. Add this option to cmake:

  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="prefix/to/lib1;prefix/to/lib2;prefix/to/lib3"

** Install prefix

The install prefix (equivalent to configure --prefix) is set using:

  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="path/where/to/install/urbiLive"

** Verbose mode

The verbose mode helps debugging your CMakeLists.txt files since cmake print
the whole command line it generates to build each target. Pass this option:

  -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON

** Exta CXX flags

Extra CXX flags are specified this way:

  -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-W -Wall -ggdb3 -fno-inline"

** Build type

You can choose your build type, debug or release, this way:

  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

** Options

Option to tweak the build of a given project are set using the
-DMYOPT=VAL arguments. Example

  -DENABLE_LOCKSYSTEM=OFF

* Directories

** modules

Holds cmake modules. See modules/README for further information about how to
write/use the provided modules.
