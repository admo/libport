#ifndef LIBPORT_TR1_TYPE_TRAITS
# define LIBPORT_TR1_TYPE_TRAITS

// Including both G++'s tr1/type_traits and Boost's
// boost/tr1/type_traits.hpp breaks (multiple definitions).  We could
// just include Boost's, but the Libstc++ (at least the one with G++
// 4.6) includes tr1/type_traits when using _GLIBCXX_PROFILE for
// instance.
//
// So rather include G++'s one if available, Boost's otherwise.  Yet,
// this is a danger that Boost defined things for itself, so reading
// boost/tr1/type_traits.hpp shows that it merely includes two files,
// and then import its boost:: stuff in std::tr1:: (this real cause of
// the conflict).  So just load these two files, just in case.
