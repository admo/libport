This directory contains files that are used through out URBI projects.

* Auxiliary tools
** libport.mk
Include this Makefile if you want to install libport.  Only liburbi
should.

* Components
** hash.hh
Hash tables.  Relies on either G++'s or MS'.  We should check for
ext/hash_map and hash_map.h instead of relying on !Windows.

** lockable.hh.
class urbi::Lockable and macro BLOCKED.

** semaphore.hh.
class urbi::Semaphore.

** thread.hh.

** utime.hh
long long urbi::utime().

* TODO

** stdext.hh
Define macros to reach the namespace of non standard extensions.
Should be extracted from hash.hh.

** documentation
Doxygenation of these components

** lib
It would be useful to compile some parts instead of putting
everything in header files (e.g., utime.cc).

** test
