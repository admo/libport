* Description

This branch tests a full ASIO network module.
It will not probably be used before the release of Boost 1.35 which
will include ASIO.

* SSL vs no SSL

Currently, HAVE_OPENSSL is defined by hand in fwd.hh (in order
to keep the uengine-linux patch as small as possible). It
defines whether a SSL connection will be used or not.

* Deployment (ASIO)

This was needs the /Boost/ version of ASIO (>=0.3.8).
This version needs Boost.System (which is bundled with ASIO).

ASIO will be packaged with Boost 1.35 (which should be released
before the end of the year), so it does not worth focusing
on packaging now.

* Modification of uengine-linux

The only modification to uengine-linux is:
** including boost.mk instead of bsdnet.mk in src/Makefile.am
** changing includes (#include <network/bsdnet/..." to "network/boost/...>)

A patch is also provided (uengine-linux.patch). It introduces the option -S / --ssl
which actives the SSL connection.

* How to use SSL

To test the SSL server, you can use the OpenSSL client:
$ openssl s_client -connect localhost:54000

CAUTION: the client has to be launched in the same directory
than the key files (*.pem).

* Required files (SSL only)

** ca.pem
** server.pem
** dh512.pem

Those files have to be copied in the current working directory
when the server is launched (i.e. _build for instance).

* How to generate a certificate

$ ./certificate.sh

Cf here: http://sial.org/howto/openssl/self-signed/

* Known issues

- make check does not work for some reason.
- a race condition seems to occur in SSL mode sometimes.

* TODO
** Use Autoconf to define HAVE_OPENSSL (and include config.h).
** Refactorize classes (simplify).
** Passphrase mechanism system.
