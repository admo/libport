  /// A Job represents a thread of control, implemented using coroutines.
  /// The scheduler decides which job to launch and resumes its execution.
  /// The lifetime of a job is the following
  ///
  /// \li   Job()                  : job creation
  ///
  /// \li   start_job()            : add job to the scheduler; the scheduler
  ///                                will call run(), and the job will
  ///                                yield() itself into the scheduler run
  ///                                queue during the course of work()
  ///
  /// \li   work()                 : this method, which must be overridden,
  ///                                does the real work
  ///
  /// Due to the way coroutines work, a job may not delete itself
  /// as once the coroutine structure has been freed, it is illegal to
  /// continue its execution, even only to switch to another coroutine.
  /// And if a job switches back to the scheduler before terminating its
  /// destructor, the coroutine structure will not be freed. Because of
  /// that, it is necessary for a job to be deleted by another one or
  /// by the scheduler.
  ///
  /// An additional constraint comes from the fact that even when a job
  /// has terminated its work, its structure may not always be deleted.
  /// For example, other jobs may have kept a reference to this job and
  /// expect to retrieve some information (such as a result) after the
  /// job termination.
  ///
  /// We have several ways of dealing with those constraints and not leaking
  /// memory upon a job termination:
  ///
  /// \li 1. Make sure the job spits out all the useful information concerning
  ///        its state by the way of inter-job communication before asking to
  ///        be deleted.
  ///
  /// \li  2. Make sure the job is kept alive as long as there is at least one
  ///         reference onto it, and that it gets deleted from another
  ///         coroutine, or from the main one.
